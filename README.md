Here is the link for my Tableau Dashboard


Regarding my story on the Dashboard, I really struggled I'm not going to lie. Anytime I added some text  it messed the size or location of the graphs on the main dashboard and I was getting confused and frustrated. I thought I was going to be able to relay all the info and story on the workbook but I failed to do so. It is to late in the course to get a tutor before our course ends and I apologize for the amateur work.



Bike Station Locations Map: Here is a map with the bike station location with the ride counts per station along with a color coding ranging from low to high useage.

Trip Duration: This bar graph shows the average trip duration per station for all its bikes. Getting to see the top popular bike station and how many mintues all their bikes have together.

Time: This line graph shows the number of trips through out the day hour by hour. We see a start early in the morning when people are heading to work, it dips after 8/9 oclock and picks up again towards the end of the day after work.

Age: Another simple line graph to read showing the count of the users age. People may be entering in really high ages which makes the graph linger on into the 100+ year olds.


I hope these visuals were easy to read and understand. Again I apologize for the amateur work, this is my first time working with Tableau and I couldn't get a tutor in time before the end of class.
